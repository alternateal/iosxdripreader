1.4.5.

- trace improvement for xbridge, correct logging of subscribed characteristic
- transmitterservice , added tracing, removed also TransmitterServiceEvent.TRANSMITTER_SERVICE_INFORMATION_EVENT, that's not used anymore
- If alarm notification, and if user opens app within 30 seconds, not via notification but by clicking app icon, then snoozedialog will pop up
- If user changes an alert setting, then it will be checked if the alert is still valid at that moment or not, and if not any applicable repeats will be disabled.
This is only for changing alerts, not alert types.
