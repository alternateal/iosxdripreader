info_app_not_always_on_anymore=As of release 0.0.54, the app does not always stay on anymore. This created issues with alerts : apparently notifications in iOS don't create sound when the app is in the foreground.\n\n If you still want to have the app always on, go to the Home screen and long press until the phone vibrates.\nThis is reset each time you lock the phone or push the home button on your device.
info_about_long_press_on_home_screen=To keep the app always on, long click on the screen till the phone vibrates.\nCan be interesting during sports activities.\n\nThis will be reset after locking the phone or pressing the Home screen.\n\nDON'T USE THIS WHILE ASLEEP because iOS does not generate sound when the app is in the foreground, hence you would not hear the alerts.
